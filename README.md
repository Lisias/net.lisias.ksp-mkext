C7's Mk 1, 2 and 3 Extensions for KSP


## Description

WiP


## Known Issues

* The Pilot's SelfieCam is out of place (the console is on the way)
* The cabin's lights are not working. I messed up the GLOW UV mapping somehow.
* Some of my aircrafts are being locked by some reason when I use the Boarding Hatch. But I'm not sure if this is my fault or some mod stomping my feet.
* The Jump Seat view revealed some glitches on the cockpit mesh. I don't remember messing up with the vertices, however - perhaps a legacy mesh error that was never discovered before?
	* That half baked measure to hide the hatch's hole on the fuselage also need some caring...
* The Boarding Hatch meshes need some work too.
